## Briefly About Myself:

I've always dreamt to be a developer. My goal is to improve my programming skills and become a full-stack developer. 

I’m a nice fun and friendly person, I’m honest and punctual, I work well in a team but also on my own as I like to set myself goals which I will achieve.  I am able to work well under pressure and adhere to strict deadlines. I am quick to learn and willing to adapt to any job. I am willing to learn new skills and have many existing ones to offer.

I work as a network analyst in IT company. My scope is DPI solutions. Sometimes I use `python` in my work for task automation. I always see ideas for task automation. But my programming skills are not always so good as to create useful applications. 

***

## Skills and Proficiency:

* HTML, CSS
* JavaScript basics
* Python basics
* SQL basics
* Git

}
```
